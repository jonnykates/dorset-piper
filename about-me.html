<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>I have over 40 years experience playing the great highland bagpipe having learned the art as a young boy from my father before continuing my bagpipe education in the Armed Forces and at the College of Piping in Glasgow where I was taught by world class teachers from Glasgow and Edinburgh.</p>
<p>I have played at the highest level, competing with a Grade One Pipe Band in Scotland and playing twice at the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. I have also travelled extensively throughout the UK and overseas attending a variety of events, which have included royalty and senior dignitaries.</p>
