<p>The bride and the bride’s maids will also be greeted before being piped in to the ceremony. I can play during the ceremony, a hymn such as Amazing grace. Or during the signing of the register. I will play as the guests are leaving and provide a few tunes while pictures are being taken.</p>
<p>I can play at the reception during the cocktail hour and then I will play the bride and groom to the top table for the wedding breakfast, offering uniqueness to your special day.</p>

<h2>When is the best time to have a piper play?</h2>

<h3>Before the ceremony</h3>
<p>A piper can announce the arrival of the bride and maybe have the piper march down the aisle playing a tune or two. Highland cathedral or Amazing Grace are good tunes to use(I have played these tunes accompanied by the church organ with great effect)</p>

<h3>During the ceremony</h3>
<p>Playing during the ceremony, this can be nice keep it short and sweet. One tune during the signing of the register.</p>

<h3>At the end of the service</h3>
<p>Have the piper start playing outside the church when the guest are leaving. The piper should play for approximately 15 minutes. Have the piper play a fast and lively tune while the bride and groom enter the limo.</p>

<h3>Playing at the receiption</h3>
<p>During the cocktail hour a solo piper can blend into the room or gardens and provide background music for your guests. When your guest are seated, it is nice to have the piper escort the bride and groom to their seats while playing the tune, “Marie’s Wedding”</p>

<h3>Choice of music</h3>
<p>The piper will have a good selection of tunes that he will play. Ask if you have a special request.</p>

<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>Piper have different fees. Several factors may influence the fee. Expect to pay extra fees for pipers that have to travel longer distances to perform at your function. Playing time – is a factor. When requesting a piper to play at the ceremony and at the reception, several hours of time may be needed to be set aside to perform at both. If you would like to contact me regarding my fees please contact me. Once I have received your request I will respond within 48 hours.</p>
