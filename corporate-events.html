<p>A traditional bagpiper can be used at corporate events and at dinner presentations. Having a piper is a highly visible and unique addition to your function, for instance, a piper can play as a presentation party goes into the function room and be available to play later on during the function. A traditional bagpiper can also be used at the opening of new business premises; people will come when they hear the sound of nicely tuned bagpipes being played well. I can provide an impressive welcome for your guests as they arrive before being piped-in to the event in style.</p>

<h2>Burns Supper</h2>
<p>Robert Burns was born in Alloway, Ayrshire on the 25th January 1759. Every year on the 25th January or around that date the world celebrates the life and work of the most famous of all Scottish poets, Robert Burns. The Burns Supper is an institution of Scottish life, a night to celebrate the life and genius of the national Bard. Suppers can be anything from an informal gathering of friends to a huge, formal dinner full of pomp and circumstance. This running order covers all the key elements you need to plan a Burns Supper that suits your intentions.<p>
<p>It is traditional to have a piper play at a burns night supper, a piper can play for the guests and welcome them on arrival.</p>

<h3>The Supper</h3>
<p>When it is time to haveing your Burns supper, the meal commences with the Selkirk Grace. After the starter of your supper usually soup, it is time for the Haggis to be served. No Burns night is complete with out the Haggis, Which is piped into the dinning room by the piper who will lead the chef into the dinning room supporting the Haggis on a silver tray. Then the address to the Haggis!</p>
<p>This is a poem (Ode to a Haggis) that your piper, honoured guest or speaker recite in a true Scottish tongue. Part way through he will take out his cleaned dirk or dagger and cut and slash into the Haggis, after this the Haggis is toasted with a glass of whisky. Prompted by the speaker, the guests will now be asked to stand and raise their glasses and shout “THE HAGGIS”. It is now time for the piper to play and lead the chef out of the dining room with the Haggis to have it cut and served. Burns Night suppers are one of my busiest evenings and I do recommend you booking early.</p>
